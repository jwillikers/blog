Backups are a good thing.
Who doesn't like having a backup when things go wrong?
While backups of user data can be accomplished at the system-level, there are many instances when a user might want to be in control of her own data.
This requires her to manage her own backups, but how d

In a previous post, <<btrfs-snapshot-management-with-snapper#,Btrfs Snapshot Management With Snapper>>, I went through the process of automating {btrfs} snapshots with {snapper}.
My ambitions go further than just that.
Backups.
I would very much like to have these snapshots used to incrementally backup my data to an external hard drive.
While {btrbk} has this feature built-in, Snapper does not.
This may come some day in the future given https://github.com/openSUSE/snapper/issues/368[Snapper issue #368 - Incremental backups].
This isn't the most difficult thing to script yourself, but why do more work than you have to?
The {bash} script {snap-sync} just does this.

== Tutorial

Bundled here is a lovely tutorial on how to use snap-sync to backup your Snapper snapshots to an external hard drive.
The backups will, of course, be encrypted on the disk using {Cryptsetup}.
This tutorial will demonstrate how to do this with `root` permissions, however this is not desirable when a user wants to backup her own snapshots herself.
Eventually, this should be achievable, but currently {snap-sync} must be run as root.
The reference system is running {elementary-os} 5.1.
For this tutorial, you should understand the command-line on Linux, Btrfs, filesystems, Cryptsetup, {systemd}, and Snapper.
As a matter of preference, the commands here use the {fish-shell}'s syntax.
It's assumed that you have configured Snapper to create snapshots of the subvolumes that are backed up in these examples.
If you haven't, please refer to <<btrfs-snapshot-management-with-snapper#,Btrfs Snapshot Management With Snapper>> before proceeding.

LOAD   = Reflects whether the unit definition was properly loaded.
ACTIVE = The high-level unit activation state, i.e. generalization of SUB.
SUB    = The low-level unit activation state, values depend on unit type.

24 loaded units listed. Pass --all to see loaded but inactive units, too.
To show all installed unit files use 'systemctl list-unit-files'.
