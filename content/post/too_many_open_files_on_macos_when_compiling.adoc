Occasionally things just go wrong during large builds.
One such occurrence is on macOS when compiling a large {cpp} project.

== Problem

The following error message is output by https://clang.llvm.org/[LLVM Clang] 10.0.1 when compiling from the command-line.
The https://www.jetbrains.com/clion/[Clion IDE] builds the project just fine, of course.

[source,sh]
----
$ cmake --build build

Too many open files...
Really?
What decade is this?!

== Solution

According to Wilson Mar's article https://wilsonmar.github.io/maximum-limits/[_Maximum limits (in macOS file descriptors)_], this issue is caused by a low default limit for the number of files that can be open simultaneously.
Digging a little bit deeper into the link:x-man-page://launchctl[`launchctl`] and link:x-man-page://setrlimit[`setrlimit`] man pages, its important to note this limit is specific to a _single process_.
What follows are step-by-step instructions for detecting and resolving this issue.

. First, check the existing soft and hard limits for the maximum number of open files.
+
--
[source,sh]
----
➜ launchctl limit maxfiles
	maxfiles    256            unlimited
----

In this case, the 256 file soft limit is the issue.
This limit is much too low.
--

. For the running session, remedy the problem by setting higher limits with `launchctl`.
+
--
[source,sh]
----
➜ sudo launchctl limit maxfiles 65536 2147483647
----

This sets the soft limit to 65,536 open files and the hard limit to 2,147,483,647 open files.

CAUTION: Don't exceed the maximum number of 2,147,483,647 for either limit here.footnote:[https://apple.stackexchange.com/a/366319/361122[AskDifferent: Why does setting the hard-limit for maxfiles to “unlimited” using `launchctl limit` result in a hard-limit slightly above the soft-limit?]]
--

. To persist this setting, create a link:x-man-page://launchd.plist[`launchd.plist`] file which will be used to launch the command every time the machine boots.footnote:[https://stackoverflow.com/a/62784288/9835303[Too many open files with Mariadb 10.4.13 on Macos Catalina]]

./Library/LaunchDaemons/limit.maxfiles.plist

    <true/>
  </dict>
</plist> 
----

[NOTE]
====
Increasing this limit with `ulimit` from a startup shell script is quick and do-able.
However, such an approach only applies to a single user, doesn't account for changing shells, and is more likely to accidentally be overwritten or deleted.
====
--

. Ensure the file is owned by the `root` user and belongs to the `wheel` group.
+
[source,sh]
----
➜ sudo chown root:wheel /Library/LaunchDaemons/limit.maxfiles.plist
----

. Set permissions on the file so that it is readable and writeable by the owner and only readable by group members and everyone else.
+
[source,sh]
----
➜ sudo chmod 644 /Library/LaunchDaemons/limit.maxfiles.plist
----

. Create a system service from the script.footnote:[https://apple.stackexchange.com/a/345974/361122[AskDifferent: How do I use non-“legacy” launchctl commands to load and unload plists?]]footnote:[https://babodee.wordpress.com/2016/04/09/launchctl-2-0-syntax/[Babo D's Corner: Launchctl 2.0 Syntax]]
+
[source,sh]
----
➜ sudo launchctl bootstrap system /Library/LaunchDaemons/limit.maxfiles.plist
----

. Set the service to run at boot.
+
[source,sh]
----
➜ sudo launchctl enable system/limit.maxfiles
----

. Verify that the limits have been updated.
+
----
➜ launchctl limit maxfiles
	maxfiles    65536          2147483647
----

. Restart your terminal application to take advantage of the increased limits.

. Check to make sure the changes have taken effect for your shell.
+
[source,sh]
----
➜ ulimit -S -n
65536
----

== Conclusion

There's a fair bit of work involved for this fix but it is quite robust.
Not only should file process limits not be an issue for you for the forseeable future, you should have gained some valuable insights into macOS service management with `launchd`.
