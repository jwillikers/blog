= Setup PPPoE on OpenBSD 6.6
Jordan Williams <jordan@jwillikers.com>
v1.0, 2020-03-12

Some ISP's establish connections with their customers' networks through PPPoE.
I recently setup an OpenBSD 6.6 router which required PPPoE.
This is my story.

== DNS Servers

If necessary, configure your system to use your preferred DNS nameservers.
[TIP]
====
A common way of connecting to your ISP's network is through https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_Host_Configuration_Protocol[DHCP].
DHCP is capable of providing your system with DNS nameservers according to https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2132#section-3.8[RFC 2132] and https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2937[RFC 2937].
To my knowledge, this capability is absent from the https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2516[PPPoE Specification].
If you are switching from DHCP to PPPoE, be mindful that you may need to set your nameservers if you have not explicitly done so.
====
The place to do this is https://man.openbsd.org/resolv.conf.5[resolv.conf].
My system uses a couple of nameservers from the https://dnscrypt.info/public-servers[list provided by DNSCrypt].
The https://developers.google.com/speed/public-dns[Google nameservers] are also quite popular.

./etc/resolv.conf
[source]
----
nameserver 176.103.130.132 # <1>
nameserver 185.228.168.10 # <2>

== PPPoE Configuration

The configuration is fairly straightforward.
I use a https://man.openbsd.org/OpenBSD-6.6/hostname.if[hostname.if] file to initialize the PPPoE interface when the system boots.
This example is very similar to the jumbo frames example provided in the https://man.openbsd.org/OpenBSD-6.6/pppoe#MTU/MSS_ISSUES[PPPOE(4)] manpage.
Because this is a router, it requires more than the basic setup. PPPoE has an overhead and the incoming LAN connections will not be aware of this.
My modifications to the example are as follows.
First, `chap` replaces `pap` as the authentication protocol.
Second, only IPv4 options are present since my ISP doesn't support IPv6.

./etc/hostname.pppoe0
[source]
----
inet 0.0.0.0 255.255.255.255 NONE mtu 1500 \ # <1>
	pppoedev em0 authproto chap \ # <2>
	authname 'username' authkey 'password' up
dest 0.0.0.1
!/sbin/route add default -ifp pppoe0 0.0.0.1
----
<1> Set the IP to `0.0.0.0`, a wildcard representing whatever IP the PPPoE connection provides, and adjust the frame size.
<2> `em0` is the ethernet interface for the router's WAN port.

The physical `em0` interface must be up.

./etc/hostname.em0
[source]
----
up mtu 1508
----

Start up the `em0` and `pppoe0` interfaces.
[source,console]
----
sh /etc/netstart em0 pppoe0
----

[CAUTION]
====
The `/etc/netstart` script was not able to successfully establish a PPPoE connection when I changed my configuration from `pap` to `chap`.
I had to reboot my system after changing the configuration file for the connection to succeed.

[source,console]
----
reboot
