Ever want to get rid of all those https://ads-blocker.com/testing/#ad-blocker-test-steps[annoying internet ads]?
Me too.
I'd been planning on using something like https://pi-hole.net/[Pi-hole], but recently stumbled upon https://www.geoghegan.ca/unbound-adblock.html[unbound-adblock], which is perfect for my OpenBSD home router.
The setup is very well-documented there, but I provide my own, slightly-modified setup instructions here.
Most notably, the cron-job runs at 6:30 AM, not midnight, and I refined the PF rule which redirects DNS requests to Google's DNS servers.

== Prepare

First, set your expectations.
Get a base-line of what ads should be blocked by working through the https://ads-blocker.com/testing/#ad-blocker-test-steps[test steps] on https://ads-blocker.com/testing.

NOTE: Disable any browser-based ad-blockers you might have enabled, otherwise you won't be able to verify your setup actually blocks ads.

== Configure

Download the https://www.geoghegan.ca/scripts/unbound-adblock.sh[unbound-adblock.sh script].

[source,console]
----
ftp https://www.geoghegan.ca/scripts/unbound-adblock.sh
----

Install the script with the appropriate permissions.

[source,console]
----
install -g bin -m 644 -o root unbound-adblock.sh /usr/local/bin/ # <1>
----
<1> The script will be owned by _root_, belong to the _bin_ group, and be readable by everyone and writeable by the owner.

Create a new user, `_adblock`, who will not be allowed to login.

[source,console]
----
useradd -s /sbin/nologin _adblock
----

Install an empty `adblock.conf` file owned by the `_adblock` user which is readable by everyone but only writeable by the owner.

[source,console]
----
install -m 644 -o _adblock /dev/null /var/unbound/etc/adblock.conf
----

Include the `adblock.conf` file at the end of the `server` section.

./var/unbound/etc/unbound.conf
[source]
----
server:
	...
	# Include the unbound-adblock configuration file.
	include: /var/unbound/etc/adblock.conf
----

Allow the `_adblock` user to reload the unbound service without requiring a password.

./etc/doas.conf
[source]
----
# Allow the unbound-adblock user / script to reload the unbound service.
permit nopass _adblock cmd rcctl args reload unbound
----

Edit the `_adblock` users crontab file.

[source,console]
----
crontab -u _adblock -e
----

Add a rule to run the `unbound-adblock.sh` script every morning at 6:30.

./var/cron/tabs/_adblock
[source]
----
# use /bin/sh to run commands, no matter what /etc/passwd says
SHELL=/bin/sh

# Update unbound-adblock at 6:30 every morning.
30	6	*	*	*	/usr/local/bin/unbound-adblock.sh
----

Run the `unbound-adblock.sh` script once.

[source,console]
----
doas -u _adblock sh /usr/local/bin/unbound-adblock.sh
----

Restart the unbound service.

[source,console]
----
rcctl restart unbound
----

Add a PF rule to redirect all DNS queries bound for Google's DNS servers, `8.8.8.8` and `8.8.4.4` to your unbound DNS server, i.e. `192.168.1.1`.
The example below uses a macro `lan_if` to represent the LAN network interface, `em1`.

./etc/pf.conf
[source]
----
# Redirect any DNS requests to Google's DNS servers to the LAN's unbound server.
lan_if = "em1"
lan_dns_server = 192.168.1.1
table <google_dns_servers> { 8.8.8.8 8.8.4.4 }
...
pass in quick on $lan_if quick inet proto { tcp udp } to <google_dns_servers> port domain rdr-to $lan_dns_server port domain
----

NOTE: Be careful to position this rule in a place where it is not superceded by a preceding `quick` rule.

My actual configuration is a bit more complex, but I have included it here for reference.

./etc/pf.conf
[source]
----
lan1_if = "em1"
lan2_if = "em2"
lan3_if = "em3"
lan4_if = "em4"
lan5_if = "em5"
secure_wifi_if = "vlan2"
guest_wifi_if = "vlan3"

lan1_dns_server = 192.168.1.1
lan2_dns_server = 192.168.2.1
lan3_dns_server = 192.168.3.1
lan4_dns_server = 192.168.4.1
lan5_dns_server = 192.168.5.1
secure_wifi_dns_server = 192.168.6.1
guest_wifi_dns_server = 192.168.7.1

table <google_dns_servers> { 8.8.8.8 8.8.4.4 }
...
pass in quick on $lan1_if inet proto { tcp udp } to <google_dns_servers> port domain rdr-to $lan1_dns_server port domain
pass in quick on $lan2_if inet proto { tcp udp } to <google_dns_servers> port domain rdr-to $lan2_dns_server port domain
pass in quick on $lan3_if inet proto { tcp udp } to <google_dns_servers> port domain rdr-to $lan3_dns_server port domain
pass in quick on $lan4_if inet proto { tcp udp } to <google_dns_servers> port domain rdr-to $lan4_dns_server port domain
pass in quick on $lan5_if inet proto { tcp udp } to <google_dns_servers> port domain rdr-to $lan5_dns_server port domain
pass in quick on $secure_wifi_if inet proto { tcp udp } to <google_dns_servers> port domain rdr-to $secure_wifi_dns_server port domain
pass in quick on $guest_wifi_if inet proto { tcp udp } to <google_dns_servers> port domain rdr-to $guest_wifi_dns_server port domain
...
----


Reload the updated PF rules.

[source,console]
----
pfctl -f /etc/pf.conf
----
