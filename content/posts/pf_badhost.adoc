Blocking connections to nefarious IP addresses in your firewall is usually a good idea.
On https://www.openbsd.org/[OpenBSD], the https://www.geoghegan.ca/pfbadhost.html[pf-badhost] script updates https://www.openbsd.org/faq/pf/[PF] to block traffic to and from such addresses.
This post walks through my installation and verification of pf-badhost.
Make sure to check out the well-written https://www.geoghegan.ca/pfbadhost.html[installation instructions], too.

== Configure

Download the https://www.geoghegan.ca/scripts/pf-badhost.sh[pf-badhost.sh script].

[source,console]
----
ftp https://www.geoghegan.ca/scripts/pf-badhost.sh
----

Install the script with the appropriate permissions.

[source,console]
----
install -g bin -m 644 -o root pf-badhost.sh /usr/local/bin/ # <1>
----
<1> The script will be owned by _root_, belong to the _bin_ group, and be readable by everyone and writeable by the owner.

Create a new user, `_pfbadhost`, who will not be allowed to login.

[source,console]
----
useradd -s /sbin/nologin _pfbadhost
----

Install an empty `pf-badhost.txt` file owned by the `_pfbadhost` user which is readable and writeable by the owner only.

[source,console]
----
install -m 600 -o _pfbadhost /dev/null /etc/pf-badhost.txt
----

Give the necessary permissions to the `_pfbadhost` user.

./etc/doas.conf
[source]
----
permit nopass _pfbadhost cmd pfctl args -nf /etc/pf.conf # <1>
permit nopass _pfbadhost cmd pfctl args -t pfbadhost -T replace -f /etc/pf-badhost.txt # <2>
----
<1> Allow `_pfbadhost` to reload the PF configuration file without a password.
<2> Allow `_pfbadhost` to update the `pfbadhost` PF table from the file `/etc/pf-badhost.txt`.

Edit the crontab file for `_pfbadhost`.

[source,console]
----
crontab -u _pfbadhost -e
----

Add a rule to run the `pf-badhost.sh` script every morning at 6:45.

./var/cron/tabs/_pfbadhost
[source]
----
# use /bin/sh to run commands, no matter what /etc/passwd says
SHELL=/bin/sh

# Update pf-badhost at 6:45 every morning.
45	6	*	*	*	/usr/local/bin/pf-badhost.sh
----

Run the `pf-badhost.sh` script.

[source,console]
----
doas -u _pfbadhost sh /usr/local/bin/pf-badhost.sh
----

Configure PF to block all traffic to or from the blacklisted addresses.

./etc/pf.conf
[source]
----
# pf-badhost configuration
table <pfbadhost> persist file ‚Äú/etc/pf-badhost.txt‚Äù # <1>
block in quick on egress from <pfbadhost> # <2>
block out quick on egress to <pfbadhost> # <3>
----
<1> Populate the `pfbadhost` table from the file `/etc/pf-badhost.txt` and keep the table even if no rules refer to it.
<2> Block any traffic coming in to the gateway from any address in the `pfbadhost` table.
<3> Block any traffic coming out of the gateway to any address in the `pfbadhost` table.

NOTE: Be careful not to block your internal network's traffic here.

Reload the PF ruleset.

[source,console]
----
pfctl -f /etc/pf.conf
----

Following the original tutorial, run the `pf-badhost.sh` script once more for good measure.

[source,console]
----
doas -u _pfbadhost sh /usr/local/bin/pf-badhost.sh
----

== Verify

Now... did that actually do anything?
I usually ask myself this question, and I like to be sure sometimes, especially when it comes to network security.

=== Outbound

First, test the outbound traffic destined for a blocked IP address.
For the outbound test, you could use any publicly available IP address which is not blacklisted.
I use the address of one of Google's DNS servers, `8.8.8.8` in this test.

NOTE: You could just ping a blacklisted server with and without the `pfbadhost` rules in place.
I definitely did this on my first go. üòä
However, I figured that probably wasn't the best idea and so devised a safer test.

Make sure that the server is reachable before adding it to the blacklist.

[source,console]
----
ping -c 3 8.8.8.8
----

There should be zero percent packet loss if everything went well, like in the following output.

[source,console]
----
PING 8.8.8.8 (8.8.8.8): 56 data bytes
64 bytes from 8.8.8.8: icmp_seq=0 ttl=52 time=9.906 ms
64 bytes from 8.8.8.8: icmp_seq=1 ttl=52 time=9.736 ms
64 bytes from 8.8.8.8: icmp_seq=2 ttl=52 time=10.039 ms

--- 8.8.8.8 ping statistics ---
3 packets transmitted, 3 packets received, 0.0% packet loss
round-trip min/avg/max/std-dev = 9.736/9.894/10.039/0.124 ms
----

If the packets don't reach the server successfully, you'll have to troubleshoot.
A PF rule could be blocking outgoing traffic to the server.
Hopefully the server your testing against isn't already on the blacklist.

Now, add the server`s IP address to the blacklist.

./etc/pf-badhost.txt
[source]
----
# User Defined Rules:
8.8.8.8
----

Update the table by reloading PF.

[source,console]
----
pfctl -f /etc/pf.conf
----

Now, verify that the server is no longer reachable.

[source,console]
----
ping -c 50 8.8.8.8
----

This should take a minute and not have any successful pings.
Your output should match the following, accounting for the IP address you selected.

[source,console]
----
PING 8.8.8.8 (8.8.8.8) 56(84) bytes of data.

--- 8.8.8.8 ping statistics ---
50 packets transmitted, 0 received, 100% packet loss, time 50168ms
----

This means `pf-badhost` is successfully blocking traffic outbound to this blacklisted IP address.
Remember to remove `8.8.8.8` from the list and reload the PF ruleset once again.

=== Inbound

Verifying the inbound traffic is not as straightforward.
My AWS server allows me to test the ability of pf-badhost to block incoming traffic from blacklisted IP addresses.
The IP address `1.2.3.4` represents the server.

First, ensure you can ping the server before it is blacklisted.
I had to add a temporary rule to my PF configuration to allow the server to ping the router.

./etc/pf.conf
[source]
----
pass in on egress from 1.2.3.4 to any # <1>

# pf-badhost configuration
table <pfbadhost> persist file ‚Äú/etc/pf-badhost.txt‚Äù
block in quick on egress from <pfbadhost>
block out quick on egress to <pfbadhost>
----
<1> Allow traffic to the router from the server.

To account for the new rule, reload the PF ruleset.

[source,console]
----
pfctl -f /etc/pf.conf
----

The IP address `2.2.2.2` will represent the router's gateway address.
From the server, ping the router.

[source,console]
----
ping -c 3 2.2.2.2
----

It should be able to ping the server, assuming the server is not one of the blacklisted IPs or impeded by a firewall rule.
Successful output should look like the following.

[source,console]
----
PING 2.2.2.2 (2.2.2.2): 56 data bytes
64 bytes from 2.2.2.2: icmp_seq=0 ttl=52 time=9.906 ms
64 bytes from 2.2.2.2: icmp_seq=1 ttl=52 time=9.736 ms
64 bytes from 2.2.2.2: icmp_seq=2 ttl=52 time=10.039 ms

--- 2.2.2.2 ping statistics ---
3 packets transmitted, 3 packets received, 0.0% packet loss
round-trip min/avg/max/std-dev = 9.736/9.894/10.039/0.124 ms
----

Now, Add the IP address of the server to `/etc/pf-badhost.txt`

./etc/pf-badhost.txt
[source]
----
# User Defined Rules:
1.2.3.4
----

Update the table by reloading PF.

[source,console]
----
pfctl -f /etc/pf.conf
----

From the server, ping the router again.

[source,console]
----
ping -c 50 2.2.2.2
----

The packets should all be dropped, printing the output below.

[source,console]
----
PING 2.2.2.2 (2.2.2.2) 56(84) bytes of data.

--- 2.2.2.2 ping statistics ---
50 packets transmitted, 0 received, 100% packet loss, time 50168ms
----

To clean up, remove the server's IP from the blacklist and reload PF.
If applicable, remember to delete the temporary rule in `/etc/pf.conf` if you added it.
