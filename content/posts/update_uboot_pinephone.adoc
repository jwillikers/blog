As I big fan of https://www.gnome.org/[GNOME], I really wanted a similar experience on the https://www.pine64.org/pinephone/[PinePhone].
That's why I opted for running https://osdn.net/projects/manjaro-arm/[Manjaro ARM]'s alpha for the PinePhone, which comes in a GNOME-like https://developer.puri.sm/Librem5/Software_Reference/Environments/Phosh.html[Phosh] flavor.
It's been running from the SD card great so far, but I thought to update the internal https://gitlab.manjaro.org/manjaro-arm/packages/core/uboot-pinephone-crust[U-Boot] as <<update_uboot_pinebook_pro#,I did on the Pinebook Pro>>.

== Tutorial

This tutorial provides instructions for updating the PinePhone's bootloader from Manjaro running off of a microSD card.
This tutorial presumes you are comfortable using the command-line on Linux and the default https://gitlab.gnome.org/ZanderBrown/kgx[Terminal app].

=== Steps

. First, ensure the system is up-to-date.
+
[source,shell]
----
$ sudo pacman -Syuu
:: Synchronizing package databases...
  core is up to date
  extra is up to date
  community is up to date
:: Starting full system upgrade...
 there is nothing to do
----

. Next, determine which device is the onboard eMMC module.
