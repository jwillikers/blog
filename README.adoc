My developer blog containing handy admin and dev guides from my myriad of tinkering.
Content is written primarily in https://asciidoctor.org/[Asciidoctor].
https://jekyllrb.com/[Jekyll] generates a static website from the content which is then deployed with https://pages.github.com/[GitHub Pages].
The website is available at https://jwillikers.com[jwillikers.com].

== Getting Started

Follow the steps below to build and run the website locally.
Dependencies are managed by {Nix}.

. Install an implementation of {Nix}, such as https://lix.systems[Lix] used here.
+
[,sh]
----
curl -sSf -L https://install.lix.systems/lix | sh -s -- install
----

. Clone the blog's repository.
+
[,sh]
----
git clone git@github.com:jwillikers/blog.git
----

. Change into the blog's directory.
+
[,sh]
----
cd blog
----

. Build and run the blog locally with Nix by running the default app.
+
[,sh]
----
nix run
----

== Development

This project's {Nix} flake provides a development environment which can be entered by running the `nix develop` command.
For convenience, direnv can be used to automatically load this environment when entering the project's directory.
The https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=mkhl.direnv[mkhl.direnv VSCode extension] integrates this environment in VSCode.
The repository contains configuration for https://pre-commit.com/[pre-commit], which can be used to automate formatting and various checks when committing changes.
Follow the instructions here to set up your development environment.

. Install direnv for your system according to the https://direnv.net/docs/installation.html[direnv installation instructions].
+
[,sh]
----
sudo rpm-ostree install direnv
sudo systemctl reboot
----

. Integrate direnv with your shell by following the instructions on the https://direnv.net/docs/hook.html[direnv Setup page].

. Permit the direnv configuration for the repository.
+
[,sh]
----
direnv allow
----

=== Build

The website can be generated locally with the `jekyll build` command.

[,sh]
----
jekyll build
----

Jekyll supports running a web server on the local machine, which can be used to preview and test changes to the website.
The steps below describe how to do this below, assuming you are in the project directory.

. Run the `jekyll` executable with the `serve` subcommand.
The `--open-url` flag is handy for automatically opening the server at `http://127.0.0.1:4000/` in your browser.
+
[,sh]
----
jekyll serve --open-url
Configuration file: /home/jordan/Source/blog/_config.yml
            Source: /home/jordan/Source/blog
       Destination: /home/jordan/Source/blog/_site
 Incremental build: disabled. Enable with --incremental
      Generating...
       Jekyll Feed: Generating feed for posts
 Auto-regeneration: enabled for '/home/jordan/Source/blog'
    Server address: http://127.0.0.1:4000/
  Server running... press ctrl-c to stop.
----

. When finished testing, type kbd:[Ctrl+C] to stop the local web server.

=== Deploy

Continuous integration is configured through GitHub Actions.
Trigger the CI to build and deploy by pushing changes to the `main` branch on the GitHub remote.

[,sh]
----
git push
----

The updated website is deployed to https://jwillikers.com[jwillikers.com].

=== Update

Update the Gems with the `just update` command.
This will update the `gemset.nix` file after updating the `Gemfile.lock` file.

[,sh]
----
just update
----
