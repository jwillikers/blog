= Manage Python Dependencies
:page-layout:
:page-category: Development
:page-tags: [asdf, direnv, Linux, Pipenv, Python, Ubuntu, Unix]

Making https://www.python.org/[Python] dependency management reproducible is complicated.
Bringing Python dependency management to mere mortals who can't remember where they put their shoes, let alone remember to source shell scripts every time they start working on a project is even more complicated.
So, here's a quick breakdown of how it works followed by a much lengthier section on how to fit all of the various pieces together to manage a single Python dependency used to build a project.

== How it Works

There are three primary components required for reproducing the runtime environment for a Python project.

.Components of a Reproducible Python Runtime
Python Interpreter:: The exact same version of the Python interpreter must be used.
The https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv[Pyenv] and https://asdf-vm.com/#/[asdf] utilities provide a great solution for managing the version of the Python interpreter on a per-project basis.footnote:[The asdf Python plugin really just uses Pyenv underneath the covers.]
Virtual Environment:: Virtual Python environments isolate installed Python packages from the rest of the system.
The older https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/latest/[virtualenv] and more recent https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html[venv] are used to create and manage these virtual environments.
However, managing these manually with these tools is cumbersome.
There many different solutions for making these tools less taxing, including https://virtualenvwrapper.readthedocs.io/en/latest/[virtualenvwrapper], https://virtualfish.readthedocs.io/en/latest/[virtualfish], https://direnv.net/[direnv], and couple which also handle package management described below. 
Python Packages:: Each package and its exact version must be recorded.
While the native Python package manager, https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/[pip], can do this with a `requirements.txt` file, there are some important ways in which this method is lacking.
That's why https://pipenv.pypa.io/en/latest/[Pipenv], https://python-poetry.org/[Poetry], and https://github.com/jazzband/pip-tools[pip-tools] use more robust methods of dependency management.
The first two also manage virtual environments.

[NOTE]
====
The tools recommended here assume a typical Unix-like shell on the command-line.
Both Pipenv and Poetry work under Windows, and there is a port of pyenv to Windows, https://pyenv-win.github.io/pyenv-win/[pyenv-win].
Unfortunately, asdf and direnv are not available for Windows proper.
Windows users can still access these tools through https://multipass.run/[Multipass], https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/about[WSL], https://www.cygwin.com/[Cygwin], and https://www.cygwin.com/[MSYS2].
====

== How to Make it Work

The question that naturally follows this explanation is how in tarnation to make all this work?

First, you need something to manage the Python interpreter.
You should probably use asdf.
It can manage more runtimes than just Python, so polyglots don't need to fuss with a million tools ending with "env" in their name, i.e. https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv[rbenv], https://github.com/syndbg/goenv[goenv], etc.

For a minimal solution, it's possible to just combine pip with either virtualenv or venv.
You should also consider the pip-tools package which, while minimal, provides some nice benefits and eases dependency management with pip.

For a robust solution, use either Pipenv or Poetry.
Poetry is a great fit for anyone wishing to package up and publish a Python project.
On the other hand, Pipenv makes more sense for Python or mixed language projects which won't produce their own Python packages.

Whichever solution you choose, for teams still consisting primarily of _humans_ I recommend a wrapper to automatically configure a project's virtual environment when entering the project directory on the command-line.
The most compelling solution for this is direnv which supports the broadest range of shells and is simple to configure.
For minimalists, https://github.com/direnv/direnv/wiki/Python#venv-stdlib-module[direnv's venv integration] is quite appropriate.
For developers only using the https://fishshell.com/[fish shell], I must recommend virtualfish for managing virtual environments.
It's fantastic.
For Pipenv or Poetry, direnv offers support out-of-the-box.

[TIP]
====
If you choose to use both asdf and direnv, I highly recommend using the https://github.com/asdf-community/asdf-direnv[asdf direnv plugin].
Not only does it make installing and controlling the direnv version a breeze but it will update executable shims for Python packages.
No need to run `asdf reshim` manually after updating or removing Python packages which provide executables.
====

[TIP]
====
Users of the fish shell might be interested in an alternative to direnv for automating the Pipenv work flow.
Check out the https://github.com/sentriz/fish-pipenv[fish-pipenv] plugin.
====

It's probably only a small fraction of developers using the command-line for all their work.
It's important to take into account how well the tooling you choose integrates with IDE's and code editors.
These will need to be aware of the appropriate interpreter and virtual environment to use for your project.
While it's usually possible to configure these things manually, think _humans_, remember?
Many IDE's and code editors integrate well with setups using the built-in Python tooling.
Pipenv boasts https://pipenv.pypa.io/en/latest/advanced/#community-integrations[community-maintained extensions] for several popular IDE's and code editors.
Even direnv works with many graphical editors through plugins.

== Tutorial

The genesis of this blog post is in incorporating a {cpp} package manager written in Python, https://conan.io[Conan], into a {cpp} project, where reproducibility and ease-of-use are both important.
This tutorial describes how to incorporate the Conan Python package in to a project via asdf, Pipenv, and direnv.
The Python runtime is managed by asdf and the https://github.com/danhper/asdf-python[asdf Python plugin].
Pipenv takes care of Conan and its dependencies as well as providing a virtual environment for the project.
The last bits, direnv and the https://github.com/asdf-community/asdf-direnv[asdf direnv plugin], smooth out the rough edges for developers.

This tutorial uses https://ubuntu.com/[Ubuntu] 20.04 as the reference system, though these instructions should transfer relatively easily to any Unix-like platform.
You should be familiar with Python, shells, Linux, and https://git-scm.com/[Git].
Instructions are provided for fish, https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/[Bash], and https://www.zsh.org/[ZSH].

The first section details how to install these tools, the second section describes the steps to configure a project, the third section describes how to initialize the environment for a previously configured project, and the last section of the tutorial describes how to handle updates for Python, Python packages, and these utilities.
Without further ado, let's begin.

=== Install

The instructions in this section will install asdf and Pipenv.
Integration for direnv will also be added, even though it will be installed in either the <<Configure>> section or the <<Initialize>> section via asdf.

. Install the dependencies needed for asdf.

HEAD is now at c6145d0 Update version to 0.8.0
----

. Enable asdf in your shell.
+
[source,sh]
----
# fish
➜ mkdir -p ~/.config/fish/conf.d; and echo "source ~/.asdf/asdf.fish" > ~/.config/fish/conf.d/asdf.fish

# Bash
➜ echo '. $HOME/.asdf/asdf.sh' >> ~/.bashrc

# ZSH
➜ echo '. $HOME/.asdf/asdf.sh' >> ~/.zshrc
----

. Install shell completions for asdf.
+
[source,sh]
----
# fish
➜ mkdir -p ~/.config/fish/completions; and ln -s ~/.asdf/completions/asdf.fish ~/.config/fish/completions

# Bash
➜ echo '. $HOME/.asdf/completions/asdf.bash' >> ~/.bashrc

# ZSH
➜ echo -e 'fpath=(${ASDF_DIR}/completions $fpath)\nautoload -Uz compinit\ncompinit' >> ~/.zshrc
----

. To make asdf available, reload your shell.
+
[source,sh]
----
# fish
➜ exec fish

# Bash
➜ source ~/.bashrc

# ZSH
➜ source ~/.zshrc
----

. Install the necessary dependencies to build Python which are helpfully documented in the https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv/wiki#suggested-build-environment[Pyenv Wiki].
+
[source,sh]
----
➜ sudo apt -y install make build-essential libssl-dev zlib1g-dev libbz2-dev \
  libreadline-dev libsqlite3-dev wget curl llvm libncurses5-dev xz-utils \
  tk-dev libxml2-dev libxmlsec1-dev libffi-dev liblzma-dev
----

. Add the https://github.com/danhper/asdf-python[Python plugin] to asdf.
+
[source,sh]
----
➜ asdf plugin add python

. Before installing Pipenv, configure the default _global_ Python version for the user.
+
--
You can use the system version of Python by default or another version of your choice.

IMPORTANT: Whenever the user's global version of Python is updated, Pipenv must be reinstalled which may require that all virtual environments be rebuilt.
--

** Use the system's Python as the default.

... Ubuntu installs Python as either `python2` or `python3` on the system.
+
--
This means that asdf won't be able to detect the system version of python.
Install the Python package `python-is-python3` to install a `python` executable for the system which uses `python3`.

[source,sh]
----
➜ sudo apt -y install python-is-python3
----
--

... Install pip and venv because they are not installed by default on Ubuntu.
+
[source,sh]
----
➜ sudo apt -y install python3-pip python3-venv
----

... Set the user's Python to the system-wide version.
+
[source,sh]
----
➜ asdf global python system
----

** Or, you can use another version of Python for your user such as the latest and greatest version.

... Build and install the latest version of Python.
+
[source,sh]
----
➜ asdf install python latest
----

... Set the user's Python to the latest version available at this time.
+
[source,sh]
----
# fish

Alternatively, run a command inside the virtualenv with pipenv run.
direnv: export +PIPENV_ACTIVE +VIRTUAL_ENV ~PATH
----

. Check that the virtual environment is properly setup and loaded, which can be verified by checking that the Conan executable resides within the virtual environment.
+
[source,sh]
----
➜ which conan
/home/ubuntu/.local/share/virtualenvs/MyProject-6C2lAvdi/bin/conan
----

=== Update

If you're going to the trouble to make your Python runtime reproducible, then you are probably planning on updating different aspects of it.
Steps for updating the various software components follow.

=== asdf

. Update asdf to the latest stable version.
+
[source,sh]
----
➜ asdf update
----

. Update an individual asdf plugin by providing the plugin name to the `asdf plugin update` command or update all plugins at once by providing the `--all` flag as shown here.
+
[source,sh]
----
➜ asdf plugin update --all
----

=== direnv

. Install the desired version of direnv.
+
[source,sh]
----
➜ asdf install direnv latest
----

. Update the project's version to reflect this newly installed version of direnv.
+
[source,sh]
----
# fish
➜ asdf local direnv (asdf latest direnv)

# Bash / ZSH
➜ asdf local direnv $(asdf latest direnv)
----

=== Pipenv

There are two ways to go about upgrading Pipenv, depending on whether you want to update the global Python version.
If the global Python version isn't changing, just <<Update Pipenv>>.
Otherwise, <<Upgrade the Global Python Version and Install Pipenv>>.

==== Update Pipenv

. Update pipx.
+
[source,sh]
----
➜ python -m pip install --user -U pipx
----

. Update Pipenv.
+
[source,sh]
----
➜ python -m pipx upgrade pipenv
----

TIP: If you want to upgrade all packages managed by pipx, just run `pipx upgrade-all`.

==== Upgrade the Global Python Version and Install Pipenv

. Build and install the newer version of Python.
+
[source,sh]
----
➜ asdf install python latest
----

. Update the global Python version for the user.
+
[source,sh]
----
# fish
➜ asdf global python (asdf latest python)

# Bash / ZSH
➜ asdf global python $(asdf latest python)
----

. Install pipx for installing Pipenv in an isolated environment.
+
[source,sh]
----
➜ python -m pip install --user pipx
----

. Install Pipenv.
+
[source,sh]
----
➜ python -m pipx install pipenv
----

=== Python

Update the project's Python version with these instructions.

. Install the desired version of Python.
+
[source,sh]
----
➜ asdf install python latest
----

. Set the Python version for the project to the desired version.
+
[source,sh]
----
# fish
➜ asdf local python (asdf latest python)

# Bash / ZSH
➜ asdf local python $(asdf latest python)
----

. Wait while direnv and Pipenv automatically install dependencies and rebuild the virtual environment.

=== Python Packages

. Check for outdated Python packages with pipenv.
+
[source,sh]
----
➜ pipenv update --outdated
----

. Update a single package by providing the name of the package or omit the package name to update all packages, as shown here.
+
[source,sh]
----
➜ pipenv update
----

== Conclusion

You should now have a thorough understanding of the requirements for reproducible dependency management in Python.
Additionally, you also understand how to use several tools to accomplish this: asdf, direnv, and Pipenv.
