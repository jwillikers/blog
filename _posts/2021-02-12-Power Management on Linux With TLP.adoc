{TLP} is a powerful power management utility for Linux.
It helps conserve battery life on mobile Linux devices by taking advantage of various kernel features.
It's also super easy to add to a system and requires no extra configuration after installation.
Though, it does expose quite a bit of configuration settings for those who want fine-grained control.

== Tutorial

The instructions use the command-line and software-management utilities built into Ubuntu, so you should be familiar with these tools.
