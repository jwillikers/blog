= A Multi-Boot USB With Ventoy

My daily driver predates Dell's support for the https://fwupd.org/[Linux Vendor Firmware Service], usually abbreviated _LVFS_.
The only way to update my motherboard's https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unified_Extensible_Firmware_Interface#Das_U-Boot[UEFI] is through Windows, which I means I'll need a Windows 10 USB installer.

Creating a USB installer on Ubuntu is typically as easy as opening https://wiki.gnome.org/Apps/Disks[GNOME Disks], selecting the desired USB disk, clicking btn:[Restore Disk Image...], and selecting the ISO or image file.
Unfortunately, creating a Windows installer is not that simple.
The best solution for this has got to be https://www.ventoy.net/[Ventoy].
Not only does it support booting more that just a single operating system, it allows booting from as many disk images as you can cram on to your drive.
The https://www.ventoy.net/en/isolist.html[long list of tested images] is also quite nice.
Runner ups include https://linuxhint.com/create-a-bootable-windows-10-usb-drive-in-linux/[GNOME Disks _plus workarounds_] and https://github.com/WoeUSB/WoeUSB-ng[WoeUSB-ng].

== Tutorial

Ventoy is a project for booting any number of arbitrary ISO's off of a single flash drive.
Once a flash drive is set up, you can just drag and drop ISO images on to the flash drive and presto!
This tutorial is broken in to three parts, creating a Ventoy flash drive, adding an ISO image to it, and updating the Ventoy flash drive.
For reference, I use https://ubuntu.com/[Ubuntu] 20.04 here, but these options will work across many Linux distributions.
This tutorial assumes you are familiar with the command-line and Linux systems.

=== Create a Ventoy Flash Drive

The first step is, of course, to setup the flash drive with Ventoy.

. Insert a flash drive in to your computer.

. Locate the device associated with your USB by using the https://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/focal/man8/lsblk.8.html[lsblk(8)] command.footnote:[Or, use https://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/focal/en/man8/fdisk.8.html[fdisk(8)], via `sudo fdisk -l`, if you prefer.]
+
[source,sh]
----
➜ lsblk

└─keystore-rpool 253:0    0   484M  0 crypt /run/keystore/rpool

<1> _sdb_ here is the 32 Gigabyte flash drive I've plugged in to my laptop.

. Ensure that nothing important is on the flash drive since it will be overwritten in a minute.

. Download the latest release for Linux, available on https://github.com/ventoy/Ventoy/releases[Ventoy's GitHub Releases page].
+
--
Download the latest release directly from the command-line with the following command.

[source,sh]
----
➜ wget -q -nv -O - https://api.github.com/repos/ventoy/Ventoy/releases/latest \
  | awk -F': ' '/browser_download_url/ && /\.tar\.gz/ \
  {gsub(/"/, "", $(NF)); system("wget -qi -L " $(NF))}'
----
--

. Use the https://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/focal/en/man1/tar.1.html[tar(1)] command to extract the archive.
+
[source,sh]
----
➜ tar xf ventoy-*-linux.tar.gz
----

. Install Ventoy on the flash drive by running the `Ventoy2Disk.sh` shell script as _root_, passing the `-i` flag and device.
+
--
Since my target system uses UEFI, I include support for https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unified_Extensible_Firmware_Interface#SECURE-BOOT[secure boot] with the `-s` flag and use a https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GUID_Partition_Table[GUID partition table] by passing the `-g` flag.
When targeting systems using legacy https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BIOS[BIOS] or depending on your target device, you may want to omit one or both of these flags.

NOTE: Some one-time setup, documented https://www.ventoy.net/en/doc_secure.html[here], is required for secure boot when booting the flash drive for the first time on a machine.

[source,sh]
----
➜ sudo ventoy-*/Ventoy2Disk.sh -i -s -g /dev/sdb

. When prompted, take a deep breath, read the message, double-check the device is correct, and type kbd:[Y] if everything checks out and you still think this is a good idea.

. That's all that is required of the downloaded Ventoy files for this tutorial, so delete them if you like.
+
[source,sh]
----
➜ rm -rf ventoy-*
----

=== Add Images

Now that the flash drive has been configured, you just have to place any desired images on to the storage partition.
Here, I walk through each step necessary to add a Windows 10 ISO to the flash drive.

. Download the https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/software-download/windows10ISO[Windows 10 ISO].

. Mount the Ventoy flash drive with the https://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/focal/en/man1/udisksctl.1.html[udisksctl(1)] command.
+
--
[NOTE]
====
Usually a USB drive is mounted automatically and you can skip this step.
If you've just created the flash drive, you'll have to manually mount it.footnote:[Or just unplug the flash drive and plug it back in.]
If you are wondering whether it is mounted or not, well, the following command won't hurt.
====

By default, Ventoy labels the storage partition on the USB drive _Ventoy_ and the boot partition _VTOYEFI_.
Here, I mount the _Ventoy_ partition by label.

[source,sh]
----
➜ udisksctl mount -b /dev/disk/by-label/Ventoy --no-user-interaction
Mounted /dev/sdb1 at /media/jordan/Ventoy
----
--

. Now just drag and drop the ISO in the _Ventoy_ partition or use https://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/focal/en/man1/cp.1posix.html[cp(1)] as shown here.
+
--
Unless Ventoy's label for the storage partition has been changed from its default, it will be mounted at _/media/$USER/Ventoy_, where `$USER` represents your username.

[source,sh]
----
➜ cp ~/Downloads/Win10_20H2_English_x64.iso /media/$USER/ventoy
----
--

. Before unplugging the flash drive, remember to unmount the filesystems.

.. Unmount the _Ventoy_ storage partition.
+
[source,sh]
----
➜ udisksctl unmount -b /dev/disk/by-label/Ventoy --no-user-interaction
Unmounted /dev/sdb1.
----

.. Unmount the _VTOYEFI_ boot partition.
+
[source,sh]
----
➜ udisksctl unmount -b /dev/disk/by-label/VTOYEFI --no-user-interaction
Unmounted /dev/sdb2.
----

. Now remove the flash drive and it's ready for use!

=== Update

Ventoy regularly releases updates which may include bug fixes and new features.
Typically, minor updates can be applied to an existing Ventoy flash drive without erasing your ISO files on the USB drive.
These instructions explain how to go about updating a Ventoy flash drive.

. Plug the Ventoy flash drive in to your computer.

. Find the your flash drive with https://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/focal/man8/lsblk.8.html[lsblk(8)] command.
+
[source,sh]

== Conclusion

Ventoy is really, really helpful for booting all kinds of operating systems off of a single USB drive.
Take advantage of that increased disk space on flash drives now-a-days for storing more than just one image at a time.
