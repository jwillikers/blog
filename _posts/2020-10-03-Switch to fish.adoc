= Switch to fish
:page-layout:
:page-category: Command-Line
:page-tags: [Debian, fish, Linux, shell, Ubuntu]

I've finally made the switch from https://www.zsh.org/[ZSH] to the https://fishshell.com/[fish shell].
Unlike ZSH, I don't need to install and manage a whole host of plugins.
Everything I want comes packaged right in as part of the shell itself.

== The Switch

In this post, I describe how to switch to the fish shell and some of the interesting features it offers.

=== Install

Installing fish is a piece of cake.
On https://ubuntu.com/[Ubuntu], a fish package is readily available.
An additional https://help.launchpad.net/Packaging/PPA[PPA] supplies newer versions of fish than those that ship with the distribution.
The following steps install fish through the PPA.

. Add the https://launchpad.net/~fish-shell/+archive/ubuntu/release-3[fish PPA].
+
[,sh]
----
sudo apt-add-repository ppa:fish-shell/release-3
----

. Update https://wiki.debian.org/Aptitude[Aptitude] with the new PPA.
+
[,sh]
----
sudo apt update
----

. Install the fish package.
+
[,sh]
----
sudo apt -y install fish
----

=== Switch

Once installed, switching is just a matter of updating the login shell.footnote:[https://fishshell.com/docs/current/tutorial.html#switching-to-fish[fish Tutorial: Switching to fish?]]

. Register `/usr/bin/fish` as a login shell by adding its path to https://manpages.debian.org/unstable/manpages/shells.5.en.html[`/etc/shells`].
+
--
Debian provides a convenient https://manpages.debian.org/unstable/debianutils/add-shell.8.en.html[`add-shell`] command to accomplish this.

[,sh]
----
sudo add-shell /usr/bin/fish
----
--

. Set the current user's login shell to fish with https://manpages.debian.org/unstable/passwd/chsh.1.en.html[`chsh`].
+
[,sh]
----
chsh -s /usr/bin/fish
Password:
----

. Now, open up a fresh terminal session to start using fish.
+
--
You should see a fresh, vanilla shell prompt like the following.

[,sh]
----
Welcome to fish, the friendly interactive shell

=== Configure

Adjusting basic configuration options is quick ang easy with fish.

. Configuring the fish shell is as easy as selecting options the provided by the web interface.
+
[,sh]
----
fish_config
----

. Style the prompt.
+
--
If you like that https://ohmyz.sh/[oh-my-zsh] feel as I do, you might want to use https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/wiki/Themes#robbyrussell[robbyrussell's theme] for your shell prompt.
If you like doing things the old fashion way - or want to set the prompt remotely, here's a quick rundown.

. Make sure the `~/.config/fish/functions` directory exists.
+
[,sh]
----
mkdir -p ~/.config/fish/functions
----

. Then copy over the desired prompt configuration, `robbyrussell.fish` in this case, from `/usr/share/fish/tools/web_config/sample_prompts/`.
+
[,sh]
----
cp /usr/share/fish/tools/web_config/sample_prompts/robbyrussell.fish ~/.config/fish/functions/fish_prompt.fish
----
--

. Adjust the color theme.
+
--
The color theme can be important when your terminal's color theme obscures autosuggestions.
https://ethanschoonover.com/solarized/[Solarized] is my color scheme of choice.
The `fish_config` web tool outputs the commands that set the various variables for a color theme when one is selected.
This is  easy to translate to a command-line which can be quite helpful when configuring remotely.
As an example, the following command sets the color scheme to solarized dark.

[,sh]
----
set -U fish_color_normal normal; \
  set -U fish_color_command 93a1a1; \
  set -U fish_color_quote 657b83; \
  set -U fish_color_redirection 6c71c4; \
  set -U fish_color_error dc322f; \
  set -U fish_color_end 268bd2; \
  set -U fish_color_selection white --bold --background=brblack; \
  set -U fish_color_search_match bryellow --background=black; \
  set -U fish_color_history_current --bold; \
  set -U fish_color_operator 00a6b2; \
  set -U fish_color_param 839496; \
  set -U fish_color_cwd green; \
  set -U fish_color_cwd_root red; \
  set -U fish_color_valid_path --underline; \
  set -U fish_color_autosuggestion 586e75; \
  set -U fish_color_user brgreen; \
  set -U fish_color_escape 00a6b2; \
  set -U fish_color_cancel -r; \
  set -U fish_pager_color_completion B3A06D; \
  set -U fish_pager_color_description B3A06D; \
  set -U fish_pager_color_prefix cyan --underline; \
  set -U fish_pager_color_progress brwhite --background=cyan; \
  set -U fish_color_host normal; \
  set -U fish_color_match --background=brblue; \
  set -U fish_color_comment 586e75

. Customize the greeting message with the variable `fish_greeting`.footnote:[https://fishshell.com/docs/current/index.html#configurable-greeting[fish Documentation: Configurable greeting]]
+
[,sh]
----
set -U fish_greeting ""
----

. Enable backwards-incompatible features.footnote:[https://fishshell.com/docs/current/index.html#future-feature-flags[fish Documentation: Future feature flags]]
+
[,sh]
----
set -U fish_features stderr-nocaret qmark-noglob
----

. Enable https://fishshell.com/docs/current/index.html#vi-mode-commands[Vi mode].
+
--
For user's who prefer http://ex-vi.sourceforge.net/[Vi] and https://www.vim.org/[Vim], there is a nifty method of enabling Vim keyboard shortcuts in addition to the default Emacs shortcuts.
Creating the file below will enable this and default to insert mode.

[,sh]
.~/.config/fish/functions/fish_user_key_bindings.fish
----
function fish_user_key_bindings
    fish_default_key_bindings -M insert
    fish_vi_key_bindings insert
end
----

[TIP]
====
Override the `fish_mode_prompt` function with an empty function to disable the Vi mode indicator.

[,sh]
.~/.config/fish/functions/fish_mode_prompt.fish
----
function fish_mode_prompt
end
----
====
--

. Now, if you're thinking about `.fishrc`, forget about it.footnote:[https://fishshell.com/docs/current/index.html#initialization-files[fish Documentation: Initialization files]]
The equivalent of `~/.bashrc` and `~/.zshrc` is `~/.config/fish/config.fish` but a lot of configuration is better achieved - and organized - through https://fishshell.com/docs/current/tutorial.html#universal-variables[_universal variables_] and https://fishshell.com/docs/current/tutorial.html#autoloading-functions[_autoloading functions_].

. Update the `PATH` environment variable in fish to suit your needs.footnote:[https://fishshell.com/docs/current/tutorial.html#path[fish Tutorial: $PATH]]
+
--
Version 3.2.0 of fish introduced the command https://fishshell.com/docs/current/cmds/fish_add_path.html#cmd-fish-add-path[`fish_add_path`] which makes permanently adding a path to `PATH` super easy.
Just use use the command followed by the path to add, and that's it!
No fiddling with configuration files necessary.
It takes care of duplicates for you, too.
Some Linux distributions don't include `/usr/local/bin` in `PATH` by default.
Adding `/usr/local/bin` to the end of the list in `PATH` is as simple as this.

[,sh]
----
fish_add_path /usr/local/bin
----

The `-p` flag prepends the given path to `PATH`.
To place `/usr/local/bin` at the beginning of `PATH`, use this command.

[,sh]
----
fish_add_path -p /usr/local/bin
----

When messing with `PATH` prior to version 3.2.0, use fish's dedicated internal variable `fish_user_paths`.
This variable is special and populates `PATH`.
With the https://fishshell.com/docs/current/cmds/set.html[`set`] command, prepend `/usr/local/bin` to `PATH` as follows.

[,sh]
----
set -pU fish_user_paths /usr/local/bin
----

The `-p` option prepends a value to the given variable.
The `-U` option signifies a https://fishshell.com/docs/current/tutorial.html#universal-variables[_universal variable_], which persists the variable in the future and across any currently running fish sessions.
This reduces the overhead of having to mess about with shell startup files.
These variables can be managed in the file `~/.config/fish/fish_variables`.

=== Learn

A lot of fish functionality has been covered already, but "there's always more to learn" as they say.
A few additional fish topics are covered here.

* Export shell variables with the `-x` flag.
+
--
This makes the variables accessible to other programs.
`PATH` is automatically exported from the contents of the un-exported `fish_user_paths` variable, making this an exception.
For everything else, export the variable by calling `set` with the `-x` flag.
To add a value to the beginning of the `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` environment variable and export it, use `set` as follows.

[,sh]
----
set -px LD_LIBRARY_PATH /usr/local/lib
----
--

* Understand how fish handles https://fishshell.com/docs/current/index.html#path-variables[_PATH variables_].
+
--
The fish shell stores lists internally as arrays of strings.
This is fundamentally different from how shells typically represent many fundamental variables which contain lists of paths, such as `PATH` and `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`.
Classic shells store these "lists" as a single string of colon-separated paths.
Many applications and programs expect the incumbent formatting, so fish treats these as special variables called _PATH variables_.
When printing or joining _PATH variables_, colons are used to delimit values when the variables are _quoted_.
Otherwise, spaces separate each path in the list.
Any variable ending in `PATH` is automatically treated as a _PATH variable_.
So, when using `set` to deal a _PATH variable_, you can still treat it as you would any other list in fish.footnote:[https://fishshell.com/docs/current/index.html#lists[fish Documentation: Lists]]
As an example, the following command adds `/usr/local/lib` to the beginning of the classic `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` variable and appends `~/lib` to the end.

[,sh]
----
set -x LD_LIBRARY_PATH /usr/local/lib $LD_LIBRARY_PATH ~/lib
----

When quoting the variable, it must be modified like so to achieve the same result.

[,sh]
----
set -x LD_LIBRARY_PATH /usr/local/lib:"$LD_LIBRARY_PATH":~/lib
----
--

* Take advantage of https://fishshell.com/docs/current/index.html#autosuggestions[autosuggestions].
+
--
Just start typing a command and fish will provide suggestions on your prompt.
As autosuggestion appear from your history, choose the suggested line with kbd:[→].
To select only the next word of the suggestion, use kbd:[Alt+→].
--

* Use fish's https://fishshell.com/docs/current/index.html#history-search[searchable history] instead of Bash's https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/html_node/Searching.html[reverse history search].
+
--
This one has required a bit of learning curve since I'm so used to finding previous commands by searching with kbd:[Ctrl+R].
With fish, this is even simpler.
Start typing the letters, word, or phrase you want to match.
Then, just press kbd:[Alt+↑] to scroll backwards through history for matches.
--

* Another nifty feature is the https://fishshell.com/docs/current/tutorial.html#wildcards[recursive wildcard] which automatically descends into subdirectories for matching a particular pattern.
+
--
The following example recursively searches and lists all files ending in `.fish` in `~/.config`.

[,sh]
----
ls ~/.config/**.fish
/home/jordan/.config/fish/functions/fish_prompt.fish
----
--

== Troubleshoot

Common issues involve various environment variables and initialization functionality which assumes the default login shell is Bash.
Some people place `fish` in their `~/.bashrc` file to start fish from within Bash so that all environment variables are correctly configured.
I prefer to use `fish` as my login shell and file bugs as necessary for projects to properly support it, but this is definitely a bit a of a pain but thus is progress, eh?

== Conclusion

There's a lot to learn about the fish shell.
It provides an extremely convenient feature set and is attempting to solve issues inherited from shells of generations past.
I love it, and its a great improvement to my workflow.
