Are you desperate for the freshest https://fishshell.com/[fish]?
Well, you've come to the right place.

== Tutorial

The instructions herein describe how to install a much newer version of the fish shell, version 3.1.2, from source on https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/[CentOS] 7.
Further instructions for building fish are available from the https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/#building[fish documentation].
For this tutorial to make a lick of sense, you should be familiar with the command-line, Linux, installing packages, and building projects from source.

. If you aren't using the https://rpm-software-management.github.io/[DNF] package manager yet, grab that.
+
[source,sh]
----
➜ sudo yum -y install dnf
----

. Add the https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/EPEL[EPEL] repository for retrieving necessary dependencies.
+
[source,sh]
----
➜ sudo dnf -y install \
  https://dl.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/epel-release-latest-7.noarch.rpm
----

. Install the build dependencies.
+
[source,sh]
----
➜ sudo dnf -y install cmake3 gettext-devel git ncurses-devel ninja-build \
  pcre2-devel
----

. Pull down the fish repository. 
+
[source,sh]
----
➜ git clone https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell.git
----

. Checkout the latest release tag.
+
[source,sh]
----
➜ git -C fish-shell switch --detach (git -C fish-shell describe --abbrev=0 --tags)
HEAD is now at 0314b0f1d Release 3.1.2
----

. Configure CMake in the directory `fish-shell/build`.
+
[source,sh]
----
➜ cmake3 -GNinja -B fish-shell/build -S fish-shell
----

. Build fish.
+
[source,sh]
----
➜ cmake3 --build fish-shell/build
----

. Install fish.
+
[source,sh]
----
➜ sudo cmake3 --install fish-shell/build
-- Install configuration: "RelWithDebInfo"
----

. Register the shell in https://www.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=shells&manpath=CentOS+7.1[`/etc/shells`].
+
[source,sh]
----
➜ echo /usr/local/bin/fish | sudo tee -a /etc/shells
/usr/local/bin/fish
----

. Change your login shell to fish.
+
[source,sh]
----
➜ chsh -s /usr/local/bin/fish
Changing shell for jordan.
Password: 
Shell changed.
----

. Log out and back in to complete the switch to fish.

. Because it is CentOS, add `/usr/local/bin` to your `PATH`.

Version 3.2.0 and newer::
+
[source,sh]
----
➜ fish_add_path -p /usr/local/bin
----

Versions prior to 3.2.0::
+
[source,sh]
----
➜ set -pU fish_user_paths /usr/local/bin
----

=== Update

To update to the latest version of fish, just checkout the latest version release, build, and install.
For completeness, the instructions to update fish are provided below.

. Checkout the latest release tag.
+
[source,sh]
----
➜ git -C fish-shell switch --detach (git -C fish-shell describe --abbrev=0 --tags)
HEAD is now at 0314b0f1d Release 3.1.2
----

. Configure CMake in the directory `fish-shell/build`.
+
[source,sh]
----
➜ cmake3 -GNinja -B fish-shell/build -S fish-shell
----

. Build fish.
+
[source,sh]
----
➜ cmake3 --build fish-shell/build
----

. Install fish.
+
[source,sh]
----
➜ sudo cmake3 --install fish-shell/build
-- Install configuration: "RelWithDebInfo"

=== Troubleshooting

Packages on CentOS 7 might assume you are using a https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/[Bash]-compatible login shell.
For instance, the https://www.qt.io/[Qt] 5 development packages work fine when using a Bash shell.
After switching to fish, building a Qt 5 application failed because it could not find the `xcb` plugin.
Setting the `QT_QPA_PLATFORM_PLUGIN_PATH` to as shown below resolved this issue.

[source,sh]
----
➜ set -Ux QT_QPA_PLATFORM_PLUGIN_PATH /usr/lib64/qt5/plugins/platforms
----

The moral of the story is to check any Bash-specific initialization in places such as the `/etc/profile` file and the `/etc/profile.d` directory.
Otherwise, it's entirely possible to use Bash as she login shell and and just execute fish from your `~/.bashrc` initialization file.
There's also a fish plugin called https://github.com/edc/bass[Bass] which can handle sourcing Bash files such as `/etc/profile` directly.
Refer to the fish page's section https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Fish#Alternative_to_fish_as_the_login_shell[_Alternative to fish as the login shell_] on the https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Main_Page[Gentoo Wiki] for the exact implementation details for these workarounds.

== Conclusion

You should notice enhanced cognitive performance from the incredible omega-3 fatty acid profile that only the freshest fish has to offer!
