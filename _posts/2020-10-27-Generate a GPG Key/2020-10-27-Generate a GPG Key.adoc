GPG comes installed with Ubuntu 20.10.

If you don't already have a GPG key, generate one associated with your commit email address.
This key will be used for signing.

. Create a new key.

Please select what kind of key you want:
(1) RSA and RSA (default)
(2) DSA and Elgamal
(3) DSA (sign only)
(4) RSA (sign only)
(14) Existing key from card
Your selection? 
----

. Enter 4096 for the key size.
----
RSA keys may be between 1024 and 4096 bits long.
What keysize do you want? (3072) 4096
Requested keysize is 4096 bits
----

. Press enter to accept the default for the length of time the key will be valid which is forever.
----
Please specify how long the key should be valid.
0 = key does not expire
<n> = key expires in n days
<n>w = key expires in n weeks
<n>m = key expires in n months
<n>y = key expires in n years
Key is valid for? (0) 
----

. Type `y` and press enter again to confirm this.
----
Key does not expire at all
Is this correct? (y/N) y
----

. Input the name to use for the key's associated identity.
----
GnuPG needs to construct a user ID to identify your key.

Real name: Ponder Stibbons
----

. Then just enter your commit email address.
----
Email address: ponder.stibbons@unseen.edu
----

. Add a comment if desired.
----

. Confirm your identity information by typing `O`.
----
You selected this USER-ID:
"Ponder Stibbons <ponder.stibbons@unseen.edu>"

Change (N)ame, (C)omment, (E)mail or (O)kay/(Q)uit? O
----

. Enter a passphrase for your key in the <<Passphrase Prompt>>.

.Passphrase Prompt

. This should output information similar to the following when your key has been successfully generated.
----
We need to generate a lot of random bytes. It is a good idea to perform
some other action (type on the keyboard, move the mouse, utilize the
disks) during the prime generation; this gives the random number
generator a better chance to gain enough entropy.
