{Podman} is a _daemonless_ container runtime for Linux compatible with {Docker}.
It offers several advantages over using Docker to manage and run containers.
First, there is no overhead associated with running a background service as is the case with Docker.
Podman also allows users to run _rootless_ containers which provides a higher degree of protection for the system.
Podman integrates deeply with Linux, taking advantage of a number of specific features.
Notably, it uses namespaces for process isolation and integrates nicely with {systemd}.
Just like {Kubernetes}, Podman is built on the concept of _pods_, groups of one or more containers, instead of individual containers.

Podman is only available in the Ubuntu repositories as of {Ubuntu} 20.10.
For older Ubuntu LTS releases, the Kubic PPA can be used to get Podman which is described here. 

== Tutorial

This tutorial provides the necessary steps to install Podman on {elementary-OS} 5.1 and {Ubuntu} 18.04.
It is assumed that you are familiar with Linux, Ubuntu, and the command-line.

. Add the Kubic repository for Podman to the system's sources list.
+
[source,sh]
----
➜ echo "deb https://download.opensuse.org/repositories/devel:/kubic:/libcontainers:/stable/xUbuntu_18.04/ /" \
  | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/devel:kubic:libcontainers:stable.list
deb https://download.opensuse.org/repositories/devel:/kubic:/libcontainers:/stable/xUbuntu_18.04/ /
----

. Import the Kubic repository's GPG key.
+
[source,sh]
----
➜ wget -qO - https://download.opensuse.org/repositories/devel:/kubic:/libcontainers:/stable/xUbuntu_18.04/Release.key \
  | gpg --dearmor \
  | sudo tee /etc/apt/trusted.gpg.d/kubic_libcontainers.gpg > /dev/null
----

. Refresh Aptitude.
+
[source,sh]
----
➜ sudo apt update
----

. Upgrade any installed packages to those from the Kubic repository.
+
[source,sh]
----
➜ sudo apt -y upgrade
----

. Install Podman.
+
[source,sh]
----
➜ sudo apt -y install podman
----

. On Ubuntu 18.04, restart dbus in order to use rootless containers.
+
[source,sh]
----
➜ systemctl --user restart dbus
----

[TIP]
====
If you're using {Btrfs} or {ZFS}, now is a good time to switch over to appropriate driver.
Just follow the simple steps in <<podman-with-btrfs-and-zfs#,Podman With Btrfs and ZFS>>.
====

== Conclusion

You should now have the power of Podman available.
When you want to use Podman, just use the same Docker command-line but substitute `podman` for `docker`.
