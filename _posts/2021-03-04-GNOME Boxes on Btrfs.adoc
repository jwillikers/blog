So, you've got {libvirt} installed on your Linux box and your looking for a simple application for running virtual machines.
Look no further than {Boxes}, so far as it meets your needs, of course.
What's that you ask?
What do you need to figure out to run on this on a {Btrfs} filesystem?
Well, you've come to the right place!
This post describes how to install and accommodate Boxes on Btrfs.

== Tutorial

This tutorial describes how to install GNOME {Boxes} on a Btrfs filesystem on {elementary-OS} 5.1 which is based on {Ubuntu} 18.04.
You'll need to have libvirt installed.
Instructions for this are available in the post <<install-libvirt-on-elementary-os-5-1#,Install libvirt on elementary OS 5.1>>, which addresses Btrfs concerns.
You should be familiar with installing software on Ubuntu and elementary OS, {Flatpak}, the command-line, and Btrfs.

[NOTE]
====
For more robust configurations and anything that doesn't _just work_ in Boxes, try {virt-manager}.
====

=== Install

Boxes is readily available in two formats, as a Flatpak and a deb package from Ubuntu's repositories.
You can install in one or both ways.
The Flatpak will receive updates to newer versions where the deb package won't be updated beyond the minor version provided, currently 3.28.
While the Flatpak will be a much newer version, development in Flatpak is still necessary to expose and connect all the necessary system components for virtualization.
Some things may not work quite right yet with the Flatpak, but I've found it to work well enough.

==== Flatpak

A Flatpak can be installed system-wide or for an individual user.
The instructions below describe both methods.
systemd, 

. Add the Flathub remote.

User::
+
[source,sh]
----
➜ flatpak --user remote-add --if-not-exists flathub https://flathub.org/repo/flathub.flatpakrepo
----

System::
+
[source,sh]
----
➜ sudo flatpak --system remote-add --if-not-exists flathub https://flathub.org/repo/flathub.flatpakrepo
----

. Install the GNOME Boxes Flatpak.

User::
+
[source,sh]
----
➜ flatpak --user install -y flathub org.gnome.Boxes
----

System::
+
[source,sh]
----
➜ sudo flatpak --system install -y flathub org.gnome.Boxes
----

==== System Package

Install the GNOME Boxes Ubuntu package.

[source,sh]
----
➜ sudo apt -y install gnome-boxes
----

=== Btrfs

By default, Boxes uses the copy-on-write {qcow2} disk image format.
If you use Btrfs on your system like I do, then you'll want to avoid placing these _CoW_ disk images on a _CoW_ Btrfs filesystem.
You'll probably want to exclude the disk images from Btrfs snapshots as well and opt to manage you disk image snapshots independently using the built-in features of qcow2.
In the future, perhaps libvirt will provide a native Btrfs storage pool making the qcow2 format unnecessary along with these workarounds.

The sections here demonstrate a couple of ways to disable _CoW_ for the disk image directory used by Boxes and how to create a separate subvolume for that directory.
The location of the Boxes disk image directory depends on whether it is installed as a Flatpak or a deb package.
Refer to {Where does Boxes store disk images} in the Boxes documentation for more information.
Commands are provide for both locations where feasible.

==== Exclude From Btrfs Snapshots

If you snapshot your filesystem, take care to exclude the Boxes virtual disk image directory by making the directory a subvolume.
Btrfs subvolumes are automatically excluded from snapshots of their parent subvolumes.
Snapshots for virtual disk images should be handled in the disk image itself.
Snapshots are provided by default qcow2 format used by Boxes.
Here's how to create the subvolume.

. Delete the current images directory.

Flatpak::
+
[source,sh]
----
➜ rmdir ~/.var/app/org.gnome.Boxes/data/gnome-boxes/images
----

System Package::
+
[source,sh]
----
➜ rmdir ~/.local/share/gnome-boxes/images
----

. Create a subvolume in its place.

Flatpak::
+
[source,sh]
----
➜ btrfs subvolume create ~/.var/app/org.gnome.Boxes/data/gnome-boxes/images
Create subvolume '/home/jordan/.var/app/org.gnome.Boxes/data/gnome-boxes/images'
----

System Package::
+
+
[source,sh]
----
➜ btrfs subvolume create ~/.local/share/gnome-boxes/images
Create subvolume '/home/jordan/.local/share/gnome-boxes/images'
----

==== Disable _CoW_

The two most straightforward ways to disable _CoW_ for a directory, or subvolume, are to use a file attribute or libvirt's storage pool feature.
Use whichever one you prefer.

[NOTE]
====
There's also the `nodatacow` mount option, but a {flat-layout} in a home directory isn't exactly the pinnacle of convenience.
====

===== chattr

The simplest way to disable _CoW_ on a particular directory or file is with {chattr} as described in {Can-copy-on-write-be-turned-off-for-data-blocks}.
This makes it easy to disable _CoW_ on the Boxes disk image directory.
To do this, _add_ the _no copy on write_ attribute with the `+C` option followed by the directory.
The following commands disable _CoW_ on Boxes' image directory.

Flatpak::
+
[source,sh]
----
➜ chattr +C ~/.var/app/org.gnome.Boxes/data/gnome-boxes/images
----

System Package::
+
[source,sh]
----
➜ chattr +C ~/.local/share/gnome-boxes/images
----

===== libvirt Storage Pool Feature

Boxes creates a dedicated libvirt storage pool.
libvirt uses the concept of storage pools to abstract the complexities involved in managing the underlying virtual machine disk images in a variety of situations.
There's a bit to it, but I'll leave out the lengthy explanation for brevity.
libvirt has fantastic documentation on its {libvirt-Storage-Management} if you wish to learn more.

[NOTE]
====
elementary OS 5.1 and Ubuntu 18.04 only ship with access to libvirt 4.0.0, so you'll need to get newer version by some external means for this to work.
====

_CoW_ can be disabled on the libvirt storage pool by configuring the appropriate storage pool feature.
libvirt stores pretty much all configuration in XML files.
This is the case for storage pools and the XML can be viewed and edited with {virsh}.
The steps here walk through the steps to disable _CoW_ on the Boxes storage pool.

. Find the Boxes storage pool with the {virsh-pool-list} subcommand.
+
--
[source,sh]
----
➜ virsh pool-list
 Name                 State      Autostart 
-------------------------------------------
 default              active     yes  
 gnome-boxes          active     yes      
----

libvirt's default pool is simply called _default_ while Boxes' pool is named _gnome-boxes_.
--

. To view the current XML configuration for a pool, use the {virsh-pool-dumpxml} subcommand followed by the pool's name.
Here I output the default pool's XML configuration where you can verify _path_ is as expected for the Flatpak.
+
[source,sh]
----
➜ virsh pool-dumpxml gnome-boxes
<pool type='dir'>
  <name>images</name>
  <uuid>02814071-7a82-4444-80f1-295cfc6f947d</uuid>
  <capacity unit='bytes'>1999372288000</capacity>
  <allocation unit='bytes'>191017480192</allocation>
  <available unit='bytes'>1808354807808</available>
  <source>
  </source>
  <target>
    <path>/home/jordan/.var/app/org.gnome.Boxes/data/gnome-boxes/images</path>
    <permissions>
      <mode>0775</mode>
      <owner>1001</owner>
      <group>1001</group>
    </permissions>
  </target>
</pool>
----


. To edit a pool's configuration, use the {virsh-pool-edit} subcommand.
To modify the Boxes pool, the command would appear as follows.
+
[source,sh]
----
➜ virsh pool-edit gnome-boxes
----

. To disable _CoW_, set the _cow_ feature with `state=no` in the pool's XML.
+
--
The snippet here illustrates the necessary XML.

[source,xml]
----
<features>
  <cow state='no'>
</features>
----

For Boxes' storage pool, the resulting XML to disable _CoW_ could appear like so.

[source,xml]
----
<pool type='dir'>
  <name>gnome-boxes</name>
  <uuid>02814071-7a82-4444-80f1-295cfc6f947d</uuid>
  <capacity unit='bytes'>1999372288000</capacity>
  <allocation unit='bytes'>191017480192</allocation>
  <available unit='bytes'>1808354807808</available>
  <features>
    <cow state='no'>
  </features>
  <source>
  </source>
  <target>
    <path>/home/jordan/.var/app/org.gnome.Boxes/data/gnome-boxes/images</path>
    <permissions>
      <mode>0775</mode>
      <owner>1001</owner>
      <group>1001</group>
    </permissions>
  </target>
</pool>

== Conclusion

That should be everything you need to get started with GNOME Boxes on a Btrfs filesystem.
Enjoy that simple virtualization.
