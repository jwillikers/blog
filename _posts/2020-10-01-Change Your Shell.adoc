Sometimes, you just want to switch to a better shell for your terminal - like https://fishshell.com/[fish].

== Tutorial

Here's a quick run through of how to change your default login shell which assumes you understand the basics of the command-line on Unix-like systems.
These instructions are exemplified on an Ubuntu 20.04 system for the fish shell but this works just the same for any shell on *BSD, Linux, and macOS.

. Install the fish package.
+
--
[source,sh]
----
➜ sudo apt -y install fish
----

This Debian package installs the `fish` executable in `/usr/bin`.
--

. Register `/usr/bin/fish` as a valid login shell by adding its path to https://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/en/man5/shells.5.html[`/etc/shells`].
+
--
Debian provides a convenient https://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/en/man8/add-shell.8.html[`add-shell`] command to accomplish this.

[source,sh]
----
➜ sudo add-shell /usr/bin/fish
----

On other systems, simply add the path manually.

[source,sh]
----
➜ echo /usr/bin/fish | sudo tee -a /etc/shells
/usr/bin/fish
----
--

. Set the default login shell of the current user to fish.footnote:[https://fishshell.com/docs/current/tutorial.html#switching-to-fish[Fish Shell Tutorial - Switching to fish?]]
+
[source,sh]
----
➜ chsh -s /usr/bin/fish
Password:
----

== Conclusion

Nice and simple, right?
It should be a piece of cake to change your login shell now.
