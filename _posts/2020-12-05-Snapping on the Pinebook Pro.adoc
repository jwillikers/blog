https://snapcraft.io/about[Snaps] are an incredible new packaging format for Linux from https://canonical.com/[Canonical].footnote:[Yes, https://flatpak.org/[Flatpaks] are great too.]
They offer application confinement and increased portability while also simplifying the development workflow.
Recently I submitted a https://github.com/snapcrafters/sublime-merge/pull/5[pull-request] to extend the https://github.com/snapcrafters/sublime-merge[Sublime Merge snap] with support for arm64 so that I could use it on my https://www.pine64.org/pinebook-pro/[Pinebook Pro].
Testing the snap locally required I figure out the process on the arm64 architecture.
There is a little bit of tweaking required as its still early days for this, but that's why I made this tutorial!

== Tutorial

This tutorial is run on https://linuxcontainers.org/[Armbian's] release of Ubuntu 20.04 Focal Fossa for the Pinebook Pro.footnote:[This isn't legitimate Ubuntu, as the kernel is maintained by the Armbian project, fyi.]
Your mileage may vary a little bit on other distributions.
You should be comfortable using the command-line on Linux, managing Unix group membership, executing privileged commands with https://www.sudo.ws/[Sudo], packaging and installing snaps, and obtaining source with https://git-scm.com/[Git].
That was a mouthful, wasn't it?
If you made it this far you probably know all of that stuff anyways, so let's jump right into it!

. Install https://www.sudo.ws/[Snapcraft].
+
[source,sh]
----
➜ sudo snap install --classic snapcraft
----

. It's still early days for https://linuxcontainers.org/lxd/[LXD] on the 64-bit ARM architecture, so install the latest candidate release.
+
[source,sh]
----
➜ sudo snap install lxd --channel candidate
----

. To avoid having to use root for LXD, add your user to the _lxd_ group.
+
--
[source,sh]
----
➜ sudo usermod -a -G lxd $USER
----

WARNING: Only place users you trust with root access in the _lxd_ group.footnote:[https://github.com/lxc/lxd#security[LXD README: Security]]
--

. Now that LXD is installed, it must be initialized.
+
[source,sh]
----
➜ lxd init --auto
----

. Get the snapcraft YAML file for an application that supports building on the _arm64_ architecture, such as the https://github.com/ubuntu-core/hello-snapcraftio[hello-snapcraftio] example project.
+
--
[source,sh]
----
➜ git clone https://github.com/ubuntu-core/hello-snapcraftio.git
----
--

. Change into the project root or the directory containing the Snapcraft YAML file, usually located in a _snap_ directory.
+
[source,sh]
----
➜ cd hello-snapcraftio
----

. Build the snap, using LXD to drive the containers.
+
--
[source,sh]
----
➜ snapcraft --use-lxd
----

****
Snapcraft usually manages containers with https://multipass.run[Multipass].
Unfortunately, Multipass has outstanding issues on the 64-bit ARM architecture.
This can be worked around by using LXD to handle the underlying containers.
****

TIP: If you run into issues with LXD here, you might try a good old fashioned restart.
--

. Now, install the _.snap_ file created in the current directory by the previous command.
+
[source,sh]
----
➜ sudo snap install --devmode --dangerous hello_*.snap
hello 2.10 installed
----

. And the magic moment, run your new snap!
+
[source,sh]
----
➜ snap run hello
Hello, world!
----

. To clean things up, remove the _hello_ snap.
+
[source,sh]
----
➜ sudo snap remove hello
----

== Conclusion

Now you know how to get up and running with building your snap packages locally on a 64-bit ARM device.
Happy snapping!
