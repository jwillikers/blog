So, let's say you've installed a fresh system on {btrfs}.
Now what?
Well, btrfs doesn't ship with optimal default settings.
Many popular Linux distributions don't improve the situation, either.
That leaves it up to the administrator to fine tune btrfs for its particular use case.

The primary way to tune btrfs is through {btrfs-mount-options} which are commonly enumerated in `{fstab}` for each volume on the system.
I use a flat layout in my `/etc/fstab` for the separate btrfs subvolumes on each system.
Subvolumes within a user's home directory, besides perhaps a standard `.snapshots` subvolume, are left out of my `/etc/fstab` to give users greater flexibility in managing their own home subvolume.

I'm planning on using btrfs for all of my Linux machines, but these are all used as desktop computers and the mount options I selected reflect this.

== fstab

First, let's look at the `/etc/fstab` file on one of my machines.

Wow, there's a bunch going on here!
This setup contains many separate subvolumes to facilitate snapshots of the root directory and users' home directories.
It also includes a btrfs swapfile.
These aspects of the file will be discussed in future posts. ðŸ˜‰

Notice that each subvolume specified here, except for `/boot`, explicitly states the mount options.
These subvolumes use a {flat-layout} as opposed to a {nested-layout}.
With the exception of the `/boot` subvolume which resides on a separate partition, they are all located at the root of `/dev/mapper/sda2_crypt`.
When using btrfs, nested subvolumes inherit the mount options of their parents and are automatically mounted.
They don't need to be included in `/etc/fstab` but they are restricted to using the exact mount options of their parents.
The {flat-layout} used here has the advantage of making it easy to view how system subvolumes are organized.

Since btrfs does it's own integrity checking, {fsck} should be disabled.
The integer in the last column of each row indicates the fsck value and setting it to zero disables fsck.

== Mount Options

Listed below are descriptions of each particular mount option.

.Mount Options
_defaults_:: Use default options: _rw_, _suid_, _dev_, _exec_, _auto_, _nouser_, and _async_.
These are not btrfs-specific.
_noatime_:: Do  not  update  inode  access  times  on  this  filesystem.
This speeds up reads since the access time metadata is not updated.
This option isn't specific to btrfs either.
_autodefrag_:: Enable automatic file defragmentation.
This automatically defragments small random writes into files.
_compress_:: Filesystem-level compression is a beautiful thing.
It increases read and write speeds while saving disk space.
The speed of _{zstd}_ compression makes it my general preference.
The `/boot` subvolume above is mounted with _lzo_ compression to accomodate an older version of Grub predating _zstd_ support, which appeared in Grub 2.04.
_commit_:: The number of seconds between periodic commits to the filesystem.
This is 30 seconds by default.
Increasing this value reduces the frequency of periodic writes which can reduce wear on the disk.
However, this also increases the risk of data loss during the event of an untimely crash.
_subvol_:: Mount the subvolume from the given path rather than the top-level subvolume.
This option is organizational and used for the {flat-layout}.

[NOTE]
====
The _ssd_ option is omitted since these settings are applied automatically when the underying storage media is solid-state.

== Conclusion

Hopefully you have a better idea of some of the available mount options for optimizing btrfs for your particular use case.
