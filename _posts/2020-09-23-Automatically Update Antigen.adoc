= Automatically Update Antigen

There's a catch when it comes to managing plugins with http://antigen.sharats.me/[Antigen] as done in <<configure-zsh#,Configure ZSH>>.

.According to the Antigen documentation:
[quote, Antigen Wiki: Commands - antigen update]
This is something you might not want to put in your .zshrc. Instead, run it occasionally to update your plugins.

I hate having to do any form of maintenance _occasionally_, especially simple maintenance.
This has two potential outcomes:

. Completely forget to do it ever.
. Do it incessantly.

Okay, there are more than just those two options.
You could create some sort of _plan_ for how often to do this.
But, if you are going to so much work you might just want to automate it.

== Tutorial

This tutorial explains how to configure https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/systemd/[systemd] services and timers to automatically update a user's ZSH plugins with Antigen once a week.
This tutorial is broken into two sections, each of which accomplishes the same goal.
The first describes how to use systemd user service and the second a system service for those unfortunate enough to be using Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and CentOS 7.

=== User-level Update Service

This particular use-case is a good fit for https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Systemd/User[systemd user services] because an Antigen and ZSH setup is a user-specific configuration.

. Create the systemd user configuration directory.
+
[source,sh]
----
$ mkdir -p ~/.config/systemd/user
----

. Create a systemd service to update the Antigen plugins.
+
--
.~/.config/systemd/user/update-antigen.service
[source,systemd]
----
[Unit]
Description=Update Antigen

[Service]
Type=oneshot
ExecStart=/usr/bin/zsh -c '. "$0" && exec "$@"' /home/jordan/.zshrc antigen update

[Install]
WantedBy=default.target
----

The command-line here is tricky because the `antigen update` command requires that the user's Antigen functions and configuration be loaded.
Of course, systemd is not going to run a command from this context automatically because it throws reproducibility right out the window.
Thankfully some bash magic can make it happen.footnote:[https://stackoverflow.com/a/49765275/9835303[StackOverflow: Using a user's .bashrc in a systemd service]]
--

. Test run the new systemd unit.
+
[source,sh]
----
$ systemctl --user start update-antigen.service
----

. Check the output of the command to make sure everything worked.
+
[source,sh]
----
$ systemctl --user status update-antigen.service

. Add a systemd timer to update the Antigen plugins once per week.
+
--
.~/.config/systemd/user/update-antigen.timer
[source,systemd]
----
[Unit]
Description=Update Antigen weekly

[Timer]
Persistent=true
OnCalendar=weekly

[Install]
WantedBy=timers.target
----

This timer has `Persistent=true` to account for the situation when the timer would fire but the user has no session running.
With this option, the timer will just fire the next time the user logs on.
--

. Set the the Antigen update timer to start when logging in.footnote:[https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Systemd/User#Basic_setup[Arch Wiki: systemd/user - Basic Setup]]
+
[source,sh]
----
$ systemctl --user enable update-antigen.timer

=== System-level Update Service

The Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and CentOS 7 distributions don't support user-level systemd services, but a system-level service is still possible, as this section describes.footnote:[https://help.tableau.com/current/server-linux/en-us/systemd_user_service_error.htm[Tableau Help: systemd User Service Failures]]

. Add a `systemd` service to update the Antigen plugins.
+
--
./etc/systemd/system/update-jordan-antigen.service
[source,systemd]
----
[Unit]
Description=Update Jordan's Antigen plugins for ZSH
After=network-online.target
Wants=network-online.target

[Service]
Type=oneshot
User=jordan
Group=jordan
ExecStart=/usr/bin/zsh -c '. "$0" && exec "$@"' /home/jordan/.zshrc antigen update

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
----

This systemd unit executes the `antigen update` command after loading the `.zshrc` file for the user `jordan`.footnote:[https://stackoverflow.com/a/49765275/9835303[StackOverflow: Using a user's .bashrc in a systemd service]]
This is run as the user `jordan` and it requires the network be online in order to update.
--

. Verify the `network-online.target` exists.footnote:[https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/systemd/NetworkTarget/[Running Services After the Network is up]]
+
[source,sh]
----
$ systemctl is-enabled NetworkManager-wait-online.service
enabled
----

. Test run the new `systemd` unit.
+
[source,sh]
----
$ sudo systemctl start update-jordan-antigen.service

. Check the output of the command to make sure everything worked.

== Conclusion

That's the tutorial.
You should now have a working systemd service to automatically update your ZSH plugins for you each week.
Don't forget to disable your update service when you decide to make the switch to the https://fishshell.com/[Fish shell]. üêü
