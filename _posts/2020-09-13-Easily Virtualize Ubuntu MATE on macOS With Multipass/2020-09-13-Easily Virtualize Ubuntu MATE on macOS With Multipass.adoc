While I was working on my recent post <<virtualize-ubuntu-desktop-on-macos-with-qemu#, Virtualize Ubuntu Desktop on macOS with QEMU>>, I came across Canonical's https://multipass.run/[Multipass] utility.
Multipass makes it extremely simple to spin up Ubuntu instances on the fly whether your on Linux, macOS, and Windows.
While your VM may not be as speedy as with QEMU, I would be remiss for not  doing a quick write-up on this tool which makes it so easy to get up and running.
The main caveat for Multipass is that it is _only_ intended for running Ubuntu and neither other Linux distributions nor other operating systems.
By default on macOS, Multipass uses https://github.com/moby/hyperkit[Hyperkit] behind the scenes.footnote:[https://discourse.ubuntu.com/t/installing-multipass-on-macos/8329[Multipass Discourse: Installing Multipass on macOS]]

== Tutorial

Setting up a desktop with Multipass is briefly described https://discourse.ubuntu.com/t/graphical-desktop-in-multipass/16229[here].
This tutorial, in contrast, provides a complete set of instructions for configuring and running a https://ubuntu-mate.org/[Ubuntu MATE] with Multipass on macOS.
This tutorial assumes you have some experience with the command-line, virtualization, Ubuntu, and macOS.

.Steps
. Download the Multipass installer https://multipass.run/download/macos[here].

. Run the installer and follow the directions to install Multipass.

. Create a new VM, allocating 2 CPU's, 4 Gigabytes of RAM, and 50 Gigabytes of disk space.
+
[source,shell]
----
$ multipass launch -c 2 -m 4G -d 50G
Launched: nurturing-eagle
----

. Launch a shell in the guest.
+
[source,shell]
----
$ multipass shell nurturing-eagle

----

. Sync the package repositories.
+
[source,shell]
----
$ sudo apt update
----

. Update any packages if needed.
+
[source,shell]
----
$ sudo apt upgrade
----

. Install the Ubuntu MATE package and an https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remote_Desktop_Protocol[RDP] server.
+
--
[source,shell]
----
$ sudo apt install ubuntu-mate-desktop xrdp
----

NOTE: To use the default desktop or other https://ubuntu.com/download/flavours[Ubuntu flavors], substitute the respective package. For example, substitute `ubuntu-mate-desktop` with `ubuntu-desktop` to install the standard Ubuntu desktop.
--

. Set a password for the default `ubuntu`.
This password will be used when making an RDP connection.
+
[source,shell]
----
$ sudo passwd ubuntu
New password:
Retype new password:
passwd: password updated successfully
----

. Back on the host, determine the IP address of the guest for the RDP session.
+
--
[source,shell]

$ multipass info nurturing-eagle
Name:           nurturing-eagle
State:          Running
IPv4:           192.168.64.2
Release:        Ubuntu 20.04.1 LTS
Image hash:     995771784f85 (Ubuntu 20.04 LTS)
Load:           0.12 0.07 0.15
Disk usage:     4.3G out of 48.3G
Memory usage:   204.7M out of 3.8G
----

Here the IP address is `192.168.64.2`.
--

. Install either https://docs.brew.sh/Installation[Homebrew] or https://www.macports.org/install.php[MacPorts] according to their installation instructions.

. Install https://github.com/FreeRDP/FreeRDP/wiki/PreBuilds#mac[FreeRDP] with https://brew.sh[Homebrew] or https://www.macports.org/[MacPorts].
+
[source,shell]
----
# Homebrew
$ brew install xquartz
$ brew install freerdp

# MacPorts
$ sudo port install FreeRDP
----

. Connect to the guest with FreeRDP.footnote:[https://github.com/awakecoding/FreeRDP-Manuals/blob/master/User/FreeRDP-User-Manual.markdown[FreeRDP User Manual]]
+
--
[source,shell]
----
$  xfreerdp /u:ubuntu /p:zorro /v:192.168.64.2 +clipboard
----

This command-line simply initiates an RDP connection to the guest at IP `192.168.64.2` using the username `ubuntu` and the password `zorro`.
The last flag enables a shared clipboard to allow copying and pasting between the host and virtual machine.
--

== Conclusion

You should now be able to create and access a virtualized Ubuntu desktop on macOS with Multipass.
What's more, it should be a piece of cake to transfer this method to running Ubuntu from a Windows or Linux host.
